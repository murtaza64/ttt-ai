# Tic Tac Toe AI

## 0. Rules
- mics on if possible
- interrupt with questions
- discuss with others
- googling, getting 'inspiration' etc. fully allowed and encouraged
- keep working on the project afterwards if you want to
- contact me at any time with questions about anything (@murtaza64 | murtaza.javaid@gmail.com)

## 1. Discussion
- introductions + logistics
- what is AI?
- tic tac toe is a solved game, but let's pretend it isn't
- how about solving mazes?

## 2. Trees, search
- DFS
- states and successors
- adversarial search, minimax

[Wikipedia on DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search?) 

## 3. Programming
- a tour of the starter code
- create an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe AI

## 4. Expanding the problem
- try your AI on 4x4 tic tac toe

## 5. Augmenting vanilla minimax
- discussion
- depth limitation and heuristics
- greedy agent

[Alpha-beta pruning--a technique to investigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)

## 6. Let's have some fun!
- build cool heuristics, improve the program, try beating other AI agents
- maybe a tournament?
